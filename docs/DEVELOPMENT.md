# Development Guide

## Current Architecture Status

The code currently defines contracts plus a first CLI/dry-run pipeline skeleton.
That is deliberate. The V0.1 goal is to turn this skeleton into a real vertical
slice while keeping the engines replaceable.

## Recommended V0.1 Build Order

1. Implement a real RAW backend adapter behind `RawProcessor`.
2. Generate previews into an output artifact folder.
3. Extract real EXIF/RAW metadata.
4. Replace the placeholder image reference with real preview dimensions.
5. Export JPEG through `ExportEngine`.
6. Add local smoke-test guidance that does not commit private photos.
7. Add import-folder watching after one-file processing works.

Already present:

- `openraw doctor`
- `openraw process --dry-run`
- artifact path planning
- checksum and source metadata
- heuristic `VisionEngine`
- rule-based `DecisionEngine`
- `recipe.v1` sidecar writing
- OpenRAW Native RAW engine scaffold
- local JPEG `ExportEngine`

## Module Ownership

- `raw`: decode, inspect, preview, and base render only.
- `vision`: analyze content only.
- `decision`: produce targets, constraints, confidence, and recipe updates.
- `portrait`: apply mask-aware and landmark-aware portrait changes.
- `color`: apply scene-aware color transforms while protecting skin.
- `film`: apply film profile behavior separate from LUTs and color correction.
- `qc`: detect clipping, halos, oversmoothing, geometry artifacts, and failures.
- `export`: write derivative files and sidecar recipes.
- `pipeline`: coordinate stages without absorbing algorithm code.

## UI Design Rule

Before implementing desktop UI screens, read `docs/UI_DESIGN.md`.

The app should feel simple, calm, and premium. Beginner operation comes first:

```text
import -> AUTO -> compare -> export
```

Advanced controls should be expandable and quiet, not dumped onto the first
screen.

## Testing Strategy

Phase 0 tests are contract smoke tests. As implementations arrive:

- test each engine adapter with fakes or small controlled inputs
- test decisions without requiring model inference
- test recipe migration separately from processing
- keep private RAW files outside Git
- add regression image support only after licensing is clear
